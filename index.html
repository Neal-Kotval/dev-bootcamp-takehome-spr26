        <p class="intro">Hi! I'm <span class="gradient">Neal Kotval</span>, a first-year Computer Science student who loves teaching other people about math, physics, and coding.</p>
        <p class="about">In high school, I created online educational videos for the nonprofit Stem for Others. I worked with local middle schools to bring free computer science and math education to my local area. I'm from Alpharetta, Georgia. In my free time, I like practicing the guitar, working on websites, and playing basketball.
